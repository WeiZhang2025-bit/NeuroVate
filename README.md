# NeuroLearn: Optimizing Digital Learning Experiences Through EEG Data

## Overview

The integration of EEG data into online education has emerged as a transformative approach for optimizing digital learning experiences. Traditional digital education methods often struggle to maintain engagement and adapt to individual learner needs, limiting their effectiveness. 

This project introduces a novel framework leveraging **EEG-based neurofeedback** to enhance **personalization, engagement, and knowledge retention** in digital learning environments. By analyzing cognitive and emotional states in real time, our system tailors educational content dynamically to improve learning outcomes.

## Key Components

### 1. Personalized Adaptive Digital Learning Framework (**PADLF**)  
   - Models each learner’s cognitive and emotional states in real time.  
   - Dynamically adjusts content recommendations and feedback.  
   - Optimizes learning paths based on EEG signals.  

### 2. Dynamic Engagement and Knowledge Enhancement Strategy (**DEKES**)  
   - Continuously monitors learner engagement levels.  
   - Triggers adaptive interventions to maintain focus.  
   - Schedules content reviews for long-term knowledge retention.  

## Features & Benefits

✅ **Real-Time Personalization** – EEG-driven adaptive learning paths.  
✅ **Enhanced Engagement** – Active tracking and intervention strategies.  
✅ **Improved Knowledge Retention** – Reinforcement through optimized review schedules.  
✅ **Neuroscience-Based Learning** – Leveraging cognitive neuroscience for smarter education.  

## Technologies Used

- **EEG Signal Processing:** MNE-Python, BrainFlow  
- **Machine Learning & AI:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
